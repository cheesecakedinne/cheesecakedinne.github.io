            <h3>It all started with the song "Black Bear" by Black Bear.</h3>
            <p>The song describes the events of a 22 year old, presumably the singer, who spots a bear across a river. The singer begins to contemplate their own life and compare their feelings and motivations to what they imagine the bear's feelings and motivations are.</p>
                <p>I feel like the song is a good reminder to enjoy my life &amp; myself. There are two quotes from the song I really like:</p><br><blockquote><h5 class="tit">ONE:</h5>"The simplicity of solitude is a hard thing to perfect. Stealing happiness from loneliness is not a simple theft, but the black bear has it figured out and gets what he deserves, and the fur that he is wearing is the fur that he prefers."<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><h5 class="tit">TWO:</h5> "And I knew that it was lovely to have a black bear thinking of me. And when he thinks, he is thoughtful. And when he rests, he is restful."</blockquote><br>
            <p>I really enjoy the song every time I listen to it. It's not the most beautiful song, but I enjoy it's simplicity and awe. The song has really made me reflect on my own life &amp; perceptions, and because of that, I've come to really appreciate the bear as a symbol of a good and full life.</p>

        <h2 class="tit">So what can I tell you about Bears?</h2>
            <p>Well, I can tell you the classic stuff everyone knows: bears are apex predators found on most continents, they're ominvorous &amp;, depending on the species, eat anything from berries to large animals, and finally that they hibernate during the winter months. So what else is there?</p>
            
            <p>First is the basic information: bears can live up to about 25 years.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>1</sup></a> The smallest type of bear is the sun bear, which usually weighs about 100 lbs, while the largest is generally considered the polar bear, which can weigh about 1700 lbs.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>1</sup></a> The Kodiak Grizzly bear, which lives in Alaska and in eastern Russia is a very close second to the polar bear, with an average weight of about 1500 lbs.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
            
            <p>Hibernation with bears drives their whole life, pretty much. In Fall of 2020, I kept track of the bears in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.katmaiconservancy.org/fat-bear-week-2020/">Fat Bear Week</a>, and they get, for lack of a better word, so chonky. To prepare for winter, they eat up to 20k calories a <em>day</em>, adding about three pounds to their weight &#40;per day&#41;.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>3</sup></a> When they go to sleep for the winter, they can weigh 1k-2k lbs, then they lose about 15-30 % of their body weight before they wake up again.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>4</sup></a> Almost aLl of their waking time is spent preparing for hibernation by putting on weight.</p>

            <p>Bears are quite intelligent &amp; one of the <em>most</em> intelligent animals native to North America.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>5</sup></a> According to PBS, they "possess the largest and most convoluted brains relative to their size of any land mammal," giving them a comparable intelligence to a three year old.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>5</sup></a> They have a remarkable ability to observe &amp; navigate the land, possibly even better than humans do.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>5</sup></a> </p>
            
            <p>Bears are also highly social creatures. They live in a little group called a "<em>sleuth</em>."<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>7</sup></a> Cubs live with their mothers for several years, learning how to take care of themselves and live off the land.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>5</sup></a> By the time they leave their mothers, they know how to search for &amp; find food, what season foods are available in, and how to harvest their food.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
            
            <p>Bears also have some very human-like traits. Bears have been seen to sit and observe mountains and rivers for hours at a time, suggesting they have a sense of beauty.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>5</sup></a> They also have been observed recently to use tools.<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>6</sup></a> Tool usage in land mammals is actually exceptionally rare outside of primates, so this is significant!<a class="ref" target="" href="#sources"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
            
            <p>While bears are obviously some really incredible and fuzzy creatures, I will continue to enjoy them from a safe distance, because they're very dangerous! Here are some tips my parents taught me to stay safe from bears when in bear country:</p>
                <br>
                <li>Always carry bells and bear spray.</li>
                <li>If you encounter a bear, back away slowly.</li>
                <li>If it notices you and tries to attack you, make yourself as big and loud as possible - do NOT run.</li>
                <li>If it's a grizzly bear, RIP.</li>
