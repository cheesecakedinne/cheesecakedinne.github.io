I had tried to play other intruments up until that point, but I struggled to keep up with them. I decided to learn to play the banjo because of it's history. The banjo has a very fraught history, with it being played both among the oppressed <em>and</em> the privileged. Over time, I feel many people associate the banjo with <em>"good ol' boys,"</em> but I feel that it is a an instrument largely of the unheard.</p></td>

                <td><h3 class="tit">The Outdoors</h3><p>One of the reasons I am so fond of the banjo, is because I spend a lot of time in the areas around <em>Asheville, NC.</em> One of the most noteable things to do in Asheville is to hike. I have been up to Mt. Mitchell a few times, but it's rather cold and crowded. Last fall, about an hour after this picture was taken, my girlfriend, my roommate, and I went to Graveyard Fields. The leaves were changing and <em>it was beautiful</em>. My sister lives near Asheville, so it's very accessable to me. When it's not <em>scorching hot</em>, I really enjoy being outside.</p></td>

It's so lovely to just lay in the outdoors with a blanket and some coffee, swaying in the wind. My friends found this one really nice spot on campus that's almost always empty. We often go out and put our hammocks up and listen to <em>jazz</em> or <em>lofi</em>. The hammocks are really nice for gathering outdoors and socially distanced, and we can just chill.</p></td>
